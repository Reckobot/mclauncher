# olauncher
The old launcher we all know and love with the quality-of-life features of the new launcher. This aims to support java 8 through modern java.

3. Run it

## How to build from source (Linux)
The commands must be run in the following order to build from source:
- `decompile.sh`
  - Downloads original jar and decompiles it
- `init.sh`
  - Turns decompiled sources into a git repository
- `applyPatches.sh`
  - Applies OLauncher patches to the decompiled sources
- `mvn clean package`
  - Compiles the patched launcher
- `genredist.sh` (optional)
  - Make sure you've run `git submodule update --init` as this script uses the `AutoOL` submodule.
  - Generates the redistributable JAR - Do not distribute the JARs in `olauncher/target`!

## How to build from source (Windows)
You need to have Maven.
In order to install Maven I recommend you use Scoop which is found ![here](https://scoop.sh/).
After that you can just run "scoop install main/maven" in console without the quotes.

Once you've done that, you can run setup.sh to build everything.
To build a restributable version, run genredist.sh.
